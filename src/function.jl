# Definitions
#

# Define F(K, V, a, b, n) to be the vector space of functions from n uniformly
# sampled points between a and b to some K-vector space V.

# Define the hat basis to be the basis of F(R, R, a, b, n), where R is some
# approximation to the field of real numbers (e.g.: Float64, Rational{Int64}),
# consisting of continuous piecewise linear functions where the ith such
# function is 1 at the ith sample point and 0 at the other sample points.

hat basis representation on the same sample points, we must extend the domain
of the derivative as follows:
- At the sample midpoints, take the average of the limit of the derivative on
either side.
- At the sample endpoints, take the inner limit of the derivative.
